This repository provides a managed C# wrapper for [GameNetworkingSockets](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets) library which is created and maintained by [Valve Software](https://www.valvesoftware.com). You will need to [build](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets#building) the native library with all required dependencies before you get started.

Usage
--------
Before starting to work, the library should be initialized using `Valve.Sockets.Library.Initialize(StringBuilder errorMessage);` function.

After the work is done, deinitialize the library using `Valve.Sockets.Library.Deinitialize();` function.

### .NET environment
##### Start a new server:
```c#
NetworkingSockets server = new NetworkingSockets();
Address address = new Address();

address.SetIPv6("::0", port);

uint listenSocket = server.CreateListenSocket(address);

StatusCallback status = (info, context) => {
	switch (info.connectionInfo.state) {
		case ConnectionState.None:
			break;

		case ConnectionState.Connecting:
			server.AcceptConnection(info.connection);
			break;

		case ConnectionState.Connected:
			Console.WriteLine("Client connected - ID: " + info.connection + ", IP: " + info.connectionInfo.address.ip.ParseIP());
			break;

		case ConnectionState.ClosedByPeer:
			server.CloseConnection(info.connection);
			Console.WriteLine("Client disconnected - ID: " + info.connection + ", IP: " + info.connectionInfo.address.ip.ParseIP());
			break;
	}
};

NetworkingMessage[] netMessages = new NetworkingMessage[1];

while (!Console.KeyAvailable) {
	server.DispatchCallback(status);

	int netMessagesCount = server.ReceiveMessagesOnListenSocket(listenSocket, ref netMessages, 1);

	if (netMessagesCount > 0) {
		Console.WriteLine("Message received from - ID: " + netMessages[0].connection + ", Channel ID: " + netMessages[0].channel + ", Data length: " + netMessages[0].length);
		netMessages[0].Destroy();
	}

	Thread.Sleep(15);
}
```

##### Start a new client:
```c#
NetworkingSockets client = new NetworkingSockets();
Address address = new Address();

address.SetIPv6("::1", port);

uint connection = client.Connect(address);

StatusCallback status = (info, context) => {
	switch (info.connectionInfo.state) {
		case ConnectionState.None:
			break;

		case ConnectionState.Connected:
			Console.WriteLine("Client connected to server - ID: " + connection);
			break;

		case ConnectionState.ClosedByPeer:
			client.CloseConnection(connection);
			Console.WriteLine("Client disconnected from server");
			break;

		case ConnectionState.ProblemDetectedLocally:
			client.CloseConnection(connection);
			Console.WriteLine("Client unable to connect");
			break;
	}
};

NetworkingMessage[] netMessages = new NetworkingMessage[1];

while (!Console.KeyAvailable) {
	client.DispatchCallback(status);

	int netMessagesCount = client.ReceiveMessagesOnConnection(connection, ref netMessages, 1);

	if (netMessagesCount > 0) {
		Console.WriteLine("Message received from server - Channel ID: " + netMessages[0].channel + ", Data length: " + netMessages[0].length);
		netMessages[0].Destroy();
	}

	Thread.Sleep(15);
}
```

##### Create and send a new message:
```c#
byte[] data = new byte[64];

sockets.SendMessageToConnection(connection, data);
```

##### Copy payload from a message:
```c#
byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];

netMessages[0].CopyTo(buffer);
```

##### Set a custom configuration:
```c#
sockets.SetConfigurationValue(ConfigurationValue.FakePacketLagSend, 80);
sockets.SetConfigurationValue(ConfigurationValue.FakePacketLossSend, 25);
sockets.SetConfigurationValue(ConfigurationValue.FakePacketReorderSend, 25);
sockets.SetConfigurationValue(ConfigurationValue.TimeoutSecondsInitial, 30);
sockets.SetConfigurationValue(ConfigurationValue.TimeoutSecondsConnected, 60);
```

##### Set a hook for debug information:
```c#
DebugCallback debug = (type, message) => {
	Console.WriteLine("Debug - Type: " + type + ", Message: " + message);
};

Library.SetDebugCallback(10, debug);
```

### Unity
Usage is almost the same as in the .NET environment, except that the console functions must be replaced with functions provided by Unity. If the `NetworkingSockets.DispatchCallback()` will be called in a game loop, then keep Unity run in background by enabling the appropriate option in the player settings.

API reference
--------
### Enumerations
#### SendType
Definitions of a flags for `NetworkingSockets.SendMessageToConnection()` function:

`SendType.Unreliable` unreliable, delivery of message is not guaranteed.

`SendType.Reliable` reliable, a message must be received by the target connection and resend attempts should be made until the message is delivered.

`SendType.NoNagle` a message will not be grouped with other messages within a timer.

`SendType.NoDelay` a message will not be buffered if it can't be sent relatively quickly.

#### IdentityType
Definitions of identity type for `NetworkingIdentity` structure:

`IdentityType.Invalid` unknown or invalid.

`IdentityType.IPAddress` IPv4/IPv6 address.

`IdentityType.GenericString` application-specific string.

`IdentityType.GenericBytes` application-specific bytes.

`IdentityType.SteamID` Steam identifier.

#### ConnectionState
Definitions of connection states for `ConnectionInfo.state` field:

`ConnectionState.None` dummy state, the connection doesn't exist or has already been closed.

`ConnectionState.Connecting` in-progress of establishing a connection initiated by `NetworkingSockets.Connect()` function.

`ConnectionState.FindingRoute` if the server accepts the connection, then this connection switch into the rendezvous state, but the end-to-end route is still have not yet established (through the relay network).

`ConnectionState.Connected` a connection request initiated by `NetworkingSockets.Connect()` function has completed.

`ConnectionState.ClosedByPeer` a connection has been closed by the peer, but not closed locally. If there are any messages in the inbound queue, they can be retrieved. Otherwise, nothing may be done with the connection except to close it using `NetworkingSockets.CloseConnection()` function. The connection still exists from an API perspective and must be closed to free up resources.

`ConnectionState.ProblemDetectedLocally` a disruption in the connection has been detected locally. Attempts to send further messages will fail. Any remaining received messages in the queue are available. The connection still exists from an API perspective and must be closed to free up resources.

#### ConfigurationString
Definitions of configuration strings: 

`ConfigurationString.ClientForceRelayCluster` code of relay cluster to use. If not empty, only relays in that cluster will be used.

`ConfigurationString.ClientDebugTicketAddress` generate an unsigned ticket using the specified game server address for debugging. A router must be configured to accept unsigned tickets.

`ConfigurationString.ClientForceProxyAddr` comma-separated list to override relays from the config with this set for debugging.

#### ConfigurationValue
Definitions of configuration values: 

`ConfigurationValue.FakeMessageLossSend` randomly discard unreliable messages instead of sending. Expected value 0-100.

`ConfigurationValue.FakeMessageLossRecv` randomly discard unreliable messages upon receive. Expected value 0-100.

`ConfigurationValue.FakePacketLossSend` randomly discard packets instead of sending. Expected value 0-100.

`ConfigurationValue.FakePacketLossRecv` randomly discard packets upon receive. Expected value 0-100.

`ConfigurationValue.FakePacketReorderSend` globally reorder outbound packets by N percentage. Expected value 0-100.

`ConfigurationValue.FakePacketReorderRecv` globally reorder inbound packets by N percentage. Expected value 0-100.

`ConfigurationValue.FakePacketLagSend` globally delay all outbound packets by N milliseconds before sending.

`ConfigurationValue.FakePacketLagRecv` globally delay all inbound packets by N milliseconds before processing.

`ConfigurationValue.FakePacketReorderTime` amount of delay in milliseconds, to apply packets reordering.

`ConfigurationValue.SendBufferSize` an upper limit of buffered pending bytes to be sent. If this limit is reached, then `NetworkingSockets.SendMessageToConnection()` function will return `Result.LimitExceeded`. Default is 524,288 bytes.

`ConfigurationValue.MaxRate` a maximum send rate clamp. This value will control the maximum allowed sending rate that congestion is allowed to reach. Default is 0 which means no limit.

`ConfigurationValue.MinRate` a minimum send rate clamp. This value will control the minimum allowed sending rate that congestion is allowed to reach. Default is 0 which means no limit.

`ConfigurationValue.NagleTime` set the Nagle timer in microseconds. When `NetworkingSockets.SendMessageToConnection()` is called, if the outgoing message is less than the size of the MTU, it will be queued for a delay equal to the Nagle timer value. This is to ensure that if the application sends several small messages rapidly, they have coalesced into a single packet. See historical [RFC 896](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc896). Default is 5000 microseconds.

`ConfigurationValue.LogLevelAckRTT` set to non-zero value to enable logging of round trip time based on acks. This doesn't track all sources of round trip time, just the inline ones based on acks, but those are the most common.

`ConfigurationValue.LogLevelPacket` a log level of SNP packet decoding.

`ConfigurationValue.LogLevelMessage` a log when messages are sent/received.

`ConfigurationValue.LogLevelPacketGaps` a log level when individual packets drop.

`ConfigurationValue.LogLevelP2PRendezvous` a log level for P2P rendezvous.

`ConfigurationValue.LogLevelRelayPings` a log level for sending and receiving pings to relays.

`ConfigurationValue.ClientConsecutitivePingTimeoutsFailInitial` if the first N pings to a port fail, mark that port as unavailable for a while, and try a different one. Some ISPs and routers may drop the first packet, so setting this to 1 may greatly disrupt communications.

`ConfigurationValue.ClientConsecutitivePingTimeoutsFail` if N consecutive pings to a port fail, after having received successful communication, mark that port as unavailable for a while, and try a different one.

`ConfigurationValue.ClientMinPingsBeforePingAccurate` the minimum number of lifetime pings that need to send, before think that estimate is solid. The first ping to each cluster is very often delayed because of NAT, routers not having the best route, etc. Until a sufficient number of pings is sent, our estimate is often inaccurate.

`ConfigurationValue.ClientSingleSocket` set all datagram traffic to originate from the same local port. By default, a new UDP socket is open up (on a different local port) for each relay. This is not optimal, but it works around some routers that don't implement NAT properly. If intermittent problems occur talking to relays that might be NAT related, try toggling this flag.

`ConfigurationValue.IPAllowWithoutAuth` don't automatically fail IP connections that don't have a strong authenticator. On clients, this means connection attempts will be made even if it can't get a cert. On the server, it means that a connection will not be automatically rejected due to authentication failure.

`ConfigurationValue.TimeoutSecondsInitial` a timeout value in seconds, to use when first connecting.

`ConfigurationValue.TimeoutSecondsConnected` a timeout value in seconds, to use after a connection is established.

`Configuration Value.FakePacketDupSend` a percentage of duplicate outbound packets.

`ConfigurationValue.FakePacketDupRecv` a percentage of duplicate inbound packets.

`ConfigurationValue.FakePacketDupTimeMax` amount of delay in milliseconds, to delay duplicated packets.

#### Result
Definitions of operation result: 

`Result.OK` success.

`Result.Fail` generic failure.

`Result.NoConnection` failed network connection.

`Result.InvalidParam` a parameter is incorrect.

`Result.InvalidState` called object was in an invalid state.

`Result.Ignored` target is ignoring sender.

### Delegates

Provides per socket events.

`StatusCallback(StatusInfo info, IntPtr context)` notifies when dispatch mechanism on the listen socket returns a connection state.

#### Library callbacks
Provides per application events.

`DebugCallback(int type, string message)` notifies when debug information with the desired verbosity come up.

`ConnectionInfo.state` high-level state of the connection described in the `ConnectionState` enumeration.

`ConnectionInfo.endReason` basic cause of the connection termination or problem.

`ConnectionInfo.endDebug` explanation in a human-readable form for connection termination or problem. This is intended for debugging diagnostic purposes only, not for displaying to users. It might have some details specific to the issue.

`ConnectionInfo.connectionDescription` debug description includes the connection handle, connection type, and peer information.

#### ConnectionStatus
Contains marshalled data with connection status for frequent requests.

`ConnectionStatus.state` high-level state of the connection described in the `ConnectionState` enumeration.

`ConnectionStatus.ping` current ping in milliseconds.

`ConnectionStatus.connectionQualityLocal` connection quality measured locally (percentage of packets delivered end-to-end in order).

`ConnectionStatus.connectionQualityRemote` packet delivery success rate as observed from the remote host.

`ConnectionStatus.outPacketsPerSecond` current outbound packet rates from recent history.

`ConnectionStatus.outBytesPerSecond` current outbound data rates from recent history.

`ConnectionStatus.inPacketsPerSecond` current inbound packet rates from recent history.

`ConnectionStatus.inBytesPerSecond` current inbound data rates from recent history.

`ConnectionStatus.sendRateBytesPerSecond` estimated rate at which data can be sent to a peer. It could be significantly higher than `ConnectionStatus.outBytesPerSecond`, meaning the capacity of the channel is higher than the sent data.

`ConnectionStatus.pendingUnreliable` number of bytes pending to be sent unreliably. This is data that recently requested to be sent but has not yet actually been put on the wire.

`ConnectionStatus.pendingReliable` number of bytes pending to be sent reliably. The reliable number also includes data that was previously placed on the wire but has now been scheduled for re-transmission. Thus, it's possible to observe increasing of the bytes between two checks, even if no calls were made to send reliable data between the checks. Data that is awaiting the Nagle delay will appear in these numbers.

`ConnectionStatus.sentUnackedReliable` number of bytes of reliable data that has been placed the wire, but for which not yet received an acknowledgment, and thus might have to be re-transmitted.

`NetworkingMessage.CopyTo()` copies payload from the message to the destination array.

`NetworkingMessage.Destroy()` destroys the message. Should be called only when the message obtained using `NetworkingSockets.ReceiveMessagesOnListenSocket` function.

### Classes
#### NetworkingSockets
Contains a managed pointer to the sockets.

`NetworkingSockets.CreateListenSocket(Address address)` creates a socket and returns a socket ID that listens for incoming connections which initiated by `NetworkingSockets.Connect()` function.

`NetworkingSockets.Connect(Address address)` initiates a connection to a foreign host. Returns a local connection ID.

`NetworkingSockets.AcceptConnection(Connection connection)` accepts an incoming connection that has received on a listen socket. When a connection attempt is received (perhaps after a few basic handshake packets have been exchanged to prevent trivial spoofing), a connection interface object is created in the `ConnectionState.Connecting` state and a `StatusCallback()` is called. Returns a result described in the `Result` enumeration.

`NetworkingSockets.CloseConnection(Connection connection, int reason, string debug, bool enableLinger)` disconnects from the host and invalidates the connection handle. Any unread data on the connection is discarded. The reason parameter is an optional user-supplied code that will be received on the other end and recorded (when possible) in backend analytics. The value should be less than `Library.maxCloseReasonValue`. The debug parameter is an optional human-readable diagnostic string that will be received on the other end and recorded (when possible) in backend analytics. If the user wishes to put the socket into a lingering state, where an attempt is made to flush any remaining sent data, the linger parameter should be enabled, otherwise reliable data is not flushed. If the connection has already ended, the reason code, debug string and linger parameter is ignored. Returns true on success or false on failure.

`NetworkingSockets.CloseListenSocket(ListenSocket socket, string remoteReason)` destroys the listen socket, and all the client sockets generated by accepting connections on the listen socket. The remote reason determines what cleanup actions are performed on the client sockets being destroyed. If cleanup is requested and the user has requested the listen socket bound to a particular local port to facilitate direct IPv4 connections, then the underlying UDP socket must remain open until all clients have been cleaned up. Returns true on success or false on failure.

`NetworkingSockets.SetConnectionUserData(Connection peer, long userData)` sets a user-supplied data for the connection. Returns true on success or false on failure.

`NetworkingSockets.GetConnectionUserData(Connection peer)` returns a user-supplied data or -1 if a handle is invalid or if any data has not be set for the connection.

`NetworkingSockets.SetConnectionName(Connection peer, string name)` sets a name for the connection, used mostly for debugging.

`NetworkingSockets.GetConnectionName(Connection peer, StringBuilder name, int maxLength)` fetches connection name to the mutable string. Returns true on success or false on failure.

`NetworkingSockets.SendMessageToConnection(Connection connection, byte[] data, SendType flags)` sends a message to the host on the connected socket. The send type parameter is optional. Multiple flags can be specified at once. Returns a result described in the `Result` enumeration.

`NetworkingSockets.FlushMessagesOnConnection(Connection connection)` if the Nagle is enabled (it's enabled by default) then the message will be queued up the Nagle time before being sent, to merge small messages into the same packet. Call this function to flush any queued messages and send them immediately on the next transmission time. Returns a result described in the `Result` enumeration.

`NetworkingSockets.ReceiveMessagesOnConnection(Connection connection, ref NetworkingMessage[] messages, int maxMessages)` fetches the next available messages from the socket for a connection. Returns a number of messages or -1 if the connection handle is invalid. The order of the messages returned in the array is relevant. Reliable messages will be received in the order they were sent. If any messages are obtained, `message.Destroy()` should be called for each of them to free up resources.

`NetworkingSockets.ReceiveMessagesOnListenSocket(ListenSocket socket, ref NetworkingMessage[] messages, int maxMessages)` fetches the next available messages from the socket. Returns a number of messages or -1 if the connection handle is invalid. Delivery order of messages among different clients is not defined. They may be returned in an order different from what they were actually received. Delivery order of messages from the same client is well defined, and thus the order of the messages is relevant. If any messages are obtained, `message.Destroy()` should be called for each of them to free up resources.

`NetworkingSockets.GetConnectionInfo(Connection connection, ref ConnectionInfo info)` gets information about the specified connection. Returns true on success or false on failure.

`NetworkingSockets.GetQuickConnectionStatus(Connection connection, ConnectionStatus status)` gets a brief set of connection status that can be displayed to the user in-game. Returns true on success or false on failure.

`NetworkingSockets.GetDetailedConnectionStatus(Connection connection, StringBuilder status, int statusLength)` gets detailed connection stats in a printable form. Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure, or > 0 if a capacity of the mutable string is not enough.

`NetworkingSockets.GetListenSocketAddress(ListenSocket socket, ref Address address)` gets local IP and port number of a listen socket. Returns true on success or false on failure.

`NetworkingSockets.CreateSocketPair(Connection connectionOne, Connection connectionTwo, bool useNetworkLoopback)` creates a pair of connections that are talking to each other e.g. a loopback communication. The two connections will be immediately placed into the connected state, and no callbacks will be called. After this, if either connection is closed, the other connection will receive a callback, exactly as if they were communicating over the network. By default, internal buffers are used, completely bypassing the network, the chopping up of messages into packets, encryption, copying the payload, etc. This means that loopback packets, by default, will not simulate lag or loss. Enabled network loopback parameter will cause the socket pair to send packets through the local network loopback device on ephemeral ports. Fake lag and loss are supported in this case, and CPU time is expended to encrypt and decrypt.

`NetworkingSockets.GetConnectionDebugText(Connection connection, StringBuilder debugText, int debugLength)` gets debug text from the connection. Returns true on success or false on failure.

`NetworkingSockets.GetConfigurationValue(ConfigurationValue configurationValue)` gets the configuration value described in the `ConfigurationValue` enumeration. Returns -1 if the configuration value is invalid.

`NetworkingSockets.SetConfigurationValue(ConfigurationValue configurationValue, int value)` sets the configuration value described in the `ConfigurationValue` enumeration. Returns true on success or false on failure.

`NetworkingSockets.GetConfigurationValueName(ConfigurationValue configurationValue)` returns a name of the `ConfigurationValue` or `null` if config value isn't known.

`NetworkingSockets.GetConfigurationString(ConfigurationString configurationString, StringBuilder destination, int destinationLength)` gets the configuration string described in the `ConfigurationString` enumeration. Returns a length if a capacity of the mutable string is not enough or -1 if the configuration string is invalid.

`NetworkingSockets.SetConfigurationString(ConfigurationString configurationString, string inputString)` sets the configuration string described in the `ConfigurationString` enumeration. Returns true on success or false on failure.

`NetworkingSockets.GetConfigurationStringName(ConfigurationString configurationString)` returns the name of a `ConfigurationString` or `null` if config value isn't known.

`NetworkingSockets.GetConnectionConfigurationValue(Connection connection, ConfigurationValue configurationValue)` gets a configuration values described in the `ConfigurationValue` enumeration. Returns true on success or false on failure.

`NetworkingSockets.SetConnectionConfigurationValue(Connection connection, ConfigurationValue configurationValue, int value)` sets a configuration values described in the `ConfigurationValue` enumeration. Returns true on success or false on failure.

`NetworkingSockets.DispatchCallback(StatusCallback callback, IntPtr context)` dispatches one callback per call if available. Optional context parameter may be specified for `StatusCallback` delegate.

#### Library
Contains constant fields.

`Library.maxCloseMessageLength` the maximum length of the reason string in bytes when a connection is closed.

`Library.maxCloseReasonValue` the maximum value of the reason code when a connection is closed.

`Library.maxMessageSize` the maximum size of a single message that can be sent.

`Library.Initialize(StringBuilder errorMessage)` initializes the native library. The capacity of a mutable string for an error message must be equal to `Library.maxErrorMessageLength`.

`Library.Deinitialize()` deinitializes the native library. Should be called after the work is done.

`Library.SetDebugCallback(int detailLevel, DebugCallback callback)` sets a callback for debug output.

`Library.Time` returns a current local monotonic time in microseconds. It never reset while the application remains alive.
